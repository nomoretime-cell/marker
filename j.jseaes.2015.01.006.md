## Highlights

Elongate gneissose and granitic domes in northern Vietnam formed in a Miocene dextral-transpressional ductile shear regime. The hanging wall-basement interface represents part of a reactivated Indosinian collisional suture, and the hanging wall rocks comprise a subduction complex. Part of the mapped Red River fault is a detachment fault rather than a major dextral strike-slip fault. 

## Abstract

Elongate Miocene gneissose and granitic domes in northern Vietnam formed in a dextral-transpressional ductile shear regime, possibly associated with large-scale restraining step-overs along dextral faults.  Initial anticlinal D1 doming involved folding of both basement and hanging wall rocks with D1 secondary folds that verge toward the anticlinal axes.  Such folds reflect dome-scale flexural slip folding.  With continued shortening, D2 detachment faults developed on the flanks of the anticlines along the hanging wall-basement interface, so that the basement was extruded vertically into the overlying hanging wall rocks.  The detachment faults were associated with D2 drag folds that verge away from the anticlinal axes. The hanging wall assemblage lacks a well-ordered stratigraphy, displaying primarily block-in-matrix fabric. We identified bedded cherts, associated with umbers and alkalic basaltic intrusions within these hanging wall rocks, a first report of such rocks from Vietnam.  The association of cherts, umbers, and basaltic intrusions and extrusions with block-in-matrix units with clastic rocks strongly suggest that the hanging wall rocks comprise part of a subduction complex.  Because the base of a subduction complex is a former subduction megathrust horizon, the hanging wall-basement interface represents a reactivated collisional suture.  Such a suture was probably associated with the Indosinian orogeny, and the basement should be the Indochina continental block. This structure may have influenced the position of Miocene dextral faulting in addition to controlling the position of the dome detachments. The well-known Red River fault marks the boundary of one of the domes, but in this region it appears to be a detachment (normal) fault rather than a dextral strike-slip fault.  However, the association with the dome evolution with large-scale restraining step-overs suggests that dextral faulting associated with dome development may lie further away from the dome axes than the detachment.

## 1. Introduction

Northern Vietnamese geologic structure is a consequence of two episodes of continental collision, Triassic collision of Indochina and south China known as Indosinian orogeny, and Tertiary collision of India and Asia known as a part of Himalayan orogeny (Lepvrier et al., 2008). The Song Ma strike-slip fault is considered a suture of the Indosinian collision (Lepvrier et al., 2008), and the Red River strike-slip fault has been proposed to have resulted from indentation or lateral extrusion associated with the Indian collision (Tapponier et al., 1982).

Northern Vietnam geology shown on the Geological and Mineral Resources Map of Viet NAM 1: 200,000, published and copyright by Department of Geology and Minerals of Viet NAM, Hanoi, features many NW-SE trending faults, some of which are strike-slip, and major, map-scale plunging-anticlines. Cores of the anticlines consist of metamorphic or granitic rocks, or partly early Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. Younger, late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic normal stratigraphic sequences are depicted as overlying and concentrically surrounding the core complexes.

Our field observations (Fig. 1) differ from the structural-stratigraphic interpretations on the published geologic map. We did not observe any strike-slip faults in outcrop, except for a part of the Red River and Song Chay faults.  The core complexes, formed and exhumed during the Tertiary, have been interpreted to be overlain by the older coherent sequences, but the sequences are broken and seldom show anticlinal structure. In the hanging wall sequences, we found bedded chert, umber, and varicolored mudstone, for the first time from northern Vietnam, as well as widely distributed limestone and basalt, which were previously interpreted as shallow sea platform limestone and intra-continental rift products by Lepvrier et al. (2008). We will show that these rocks likely represent an accretionary complex.

Regarding the dome structures within the Red River shear zone, long a focus of northern Vietnam geology, Leloup et al. (2001) considered the Dai Nui Con Voi dome a left-lateral ductile shear zone forming an anticline with NW-SE axis with contemporaneous stretching and doming resulting from a single transtensive episode. They connected the movement along this shear zone with opening of the South China Sea (Tapponnier et al., 1982). Jolivet et al. (2001) also proposed a transtensive origin for the dome, but divided its evolution into an earlier ductile stage characterized by top to the NW shear and stretching restricted to the anticlinal core, followed by left-lateral shear restricted to the margins that took place under conditions of brittle-ductile transition. They proposed that the exhumation and doming was due to normal faulting of the Song Chay fault and attenuation of the hanging wall rocks. Anczkiewicz et al. (2007) also suggested that doming took place under conditions of left-lateral transtension, but showed that both marginal faults have a component of normal faulting. They also showed that the progressive deformation that included mylonitic shearing took place at relatively high temperature. Yeh et al. (2008) interpreted that ductile doming was associated with sinistral transpression (their D3) that followed tops-to-the northwest deformation (their D2). They suggested that brittle sinistral-transtensive deformation (their D4) followed ductile doming.  Cao et al. (2011) showed that ductile sinistral deformation along the northern part of the Ailao Shan-Red River shear zone took place between about 31 Ma and 20 Ma, based on U-Pb zircon data and fabrics of pre-, syn-, and post-kinematic plutons.  Roger et al. (2000) interpreted localized Plio-Quaternary dextral faulting and associated transtensional deformation to have followed Oligo-Miocene sinistral deformation.

Our interpreted order of structures, that we will detail below, encompasses an earlier D1 (corresponding to D3 of Yeh et al., (2008) ductile and later D2 (corresponding to D4 of Yeh et al., 2008) brittle-ductile transition deformation, common to both the core complexes as well as sedimentary hanging wall extruded by the core complexes. At variance to other studies, we propose that the earlier D1 deformation was associated with dextral-transpressional ductile shear.

In the following sections we describe the geology of northern Vietnam, the Miocene D1 structures, and the successive vertical D2 extrusion of metamorphic core complexes into older accretionary complexes that were further deformed by this extrusion. The core complex should be originally the Indochina continental block and the tectonic contact with the hanging wall rocks should be originally one of the collision suture against the China continent. We also show that much of the Red River fault where mapped in this region has normal fault sense movement, rather than it being a major dextral fault. 

## 2. Outline Of Geology

The Dai Nui Con Voi dome is an elongate NW-SE trending gneiss dome bounded to the SW by the Red River fault and to the NE by the Song Chay fault (Fig. 1). Exhumation of the gneiss occurred in the Miocene (e. g., Leloup et al., 2001) and a similar age is expected for the other domes.   Northeast of the northern Dai Nui Con Voi dome, is the Miocene Song Chay granitic dome, which has a NE-SW, rather than a NW-SE, axis (Fig. 1; Roger et al., 2000; Maluski *et al*., 2001; Viola and Anczkiewicz, 2007; Lepvrier et al., 2011).

West of the northern Dai Nui Con Voi dome, is the Bao Ha gneiss dome, separated from the Dai Nui Con Voi dome by the Red River fault (Fig. 1). Further west is the southern extension of the Chinese Alio Shan dome consisting both of gneiss and granite. This dome is locally separated from the westernmost dome in this area, the granitic Phan Si Pan dome, by intervening hanging wall sediments, part of which have been called the Sa Pa nappe (Leloup, et al., 2001; Fig. 1). The elongate, NW-SE-trending Alio Shan and Phan Si Pan domes extend to the SE, merging into a single dome composed mostly of volcanic rocks (Fig. 1). Between the southwestern end of the Alio Shan-Phan Si Pan dome and the Dai Nui Con Voi dome is the Hoa Binh dome, which is bounded on its NE margin by a reverse fault (Fig. 1). A smaller dome in this area is the Thanh Son dome (Fig. 1).  Further south, across the Song Ma suture (Lepvrier et al., 2008), is the well-known Miocene Bu Khang metamorphic dome (Jolivet et al., 1999), elongated WNW-ESE (Fig. 1).

In Figure 2, we show a new structural model that we obtained for the progressive doming, and structural components are fully shown.  In every dome (Fig. 3A), earlier phase of ductile deformation and doming includes the development of a D1 stretching lineation (Fig. 3B), and this is followed by a later brittle-ductile transition to brittle deformation phase including that includes D2 faulting marked by gouge (Fig. 3C). The Red River fault is this type of D2 structure. 

Prograde and retrograde metamorphism (latter associated with cooling and 
exhumation) of the dome has been interpreted to have taken place within a short time span 20~25 Ma based on 40Ar/ 39Ar geochronology (references cited above; Wang et al., 1998, 2000); older ages including early Paleozoic and Archean earlier ages associated with development of the continental basement protoliths (Lan et al., 2001; Usuki et al., 2009; Faure et al., 2014).  In contrast, the multi-method study (Rb/Sr, multi mineral 40Ar/ 39Ar, zircon and apatite fission track) of Roger et al., 2000 interpreted Permo-Triassic peak metamorphism, possibly associated with the Indosinian orogeny, followed by two cooling/exhumation events, one in the early Cretaceous and the second from about 41 to 25 Ma, corresponding to dome development.  Recent SHRIMP U-Pb dating of metamorphic zircons integrated with thermobarometric studies of metamorphic assemblages from the Dai Nui Con Voi suggest HT-HP (750-850°C, 1.25-1.4 GPa) metamorphism at ca. 59 Ma, followed by UHT metamorphism (>900°C, >0.9-0.94 GPa) at ca. 40 Ma and isothermal decompression at ca. 30 Ma (Zhang et al., 2014).  These results are consistent with the interpretations of Yeh et al. (2008) who suggested a significant syn-metamorphic deformational event (their D2) the postdated the Indosinian orogeny but predated doming and inception of strike-slip deformation.

The inferred hanging wall rocks show no succession from Cambrian to Triassic as shown in Geological and Mineral Resources Map of Viet NAM 1: 200,000. The lack of a true stratigraphic sequence is owing to the fact that most the rocks exhibit block-and-matrix relationships that may reflect an origin in an accretionary complex as discussed later.  The so-called "cover strata" may be better termed the "hanging wall" assemblage for the domes.  The general structural trend in hanging wall rocks is NW-SE (Fig. 3A), except near the domes, where the structures are dominated by D2 anticlines (Fig. 3B), parallel to the dome long axes. D1 dome structures thus also affect hanging wall rocks (Fig. 3A), but older original accretionary structures and metamorphism have been largely overprinted and obscured. 

## 3. Dome Structure

3. 1. Dai Nui Con Voi dome, and Song Chay and Red River faults

3. 1. 1. Dome 
The Dai Nui Con Voi dome consists primarily of gneiss consisting of biotite, muscovite, silimanite, quartz, with porphyroblasts of garnet and plagioclase, as well as some amphibolite made up of hornblende and plagioclase.  These metamorphic rocks are typical L-tectonites, and minerals stretched or elongated NW-SE define D1 stretching lineations (L1) formed on a D1 foliation (S1; Fig. 3B). D1 stretching lineations have generally low to moderate plunge and their average trend is slightly oblique to the average S0 foliation strike (more northerly or southerly; Fig. 3A). Prolate strain can be estimated by the stretched shape of these minerals, especially plagioclase porphryroblasts (Fig. 3D; see procedure shown in Osozawa et al., 2004, 2009).

In XZ sections cut parallel to the D1 lineation (L1) and orthogonal to the mildly developed D1 foliation (S1; S0 is more distinct but the strike is subparallel to S1), dextral ductile shear is indicated by asymmetric pressure shadows around garnet and plagioclase crystals observed in the both limbs of dome (Fig. 4).

In YZ sections made orthogonal to the L1 and S1, plagioclase porphyroblasts are nearly spherical, but mildly developed asymmetric folds are observed (Fig. 5). In this case, the D0 foliations (S0), represented by biotite-dominant layers, are folded. An S1 foliation parallel to the axial planes of such folds, defined by mildly developed preferred alignment of polygonized quartz aggregates oblique to that defining the S0 foliation. The obliqueness of these two foliations is high in axial region and low in both limbs, although S1 is steeper than S0. The shear sense is toward dome axis on outcrop and thin-section scale, and the vergence is SW for the NE limb (Fig. 5A, B, F) and NE for the SW limb (Fig. 5C, D, E).  Therefore, the doming defined by folded S0 foliations and associated with D1 axial planar foliations (S1) was generated by D1 transpressional and dextral ductile shearing (Fig. 2 top).

The other component of the metamorphic dome is amphibolite, which is partly interlayered with gneiss. D1 asymmetric structure in XZ and YZ sections are poorly developed in the amphibolite.

Our sense-of-shear determination is inconsistent with previous studies. Leloup et al. (2001), Jolivet et al. (2001), Searle (2006), and Anczkiewicz et al. (2007) suggest sinistral shear along the NW-SE trending dome.   Yeh et al. (2008) interpreted three different stages of ductile deformation (their D1 to D3), the last of which involved sinistral transpression associated with dome formation (i.e., equivalent to D1 of this study).  They identified apparent dextral transpressional fabrics associated with dome formation but ascribed these features to superposition of sinistral-transpressional D3 deformation upon earlier fabrics. Accordingly, our structural observations are similar to those of Yeh et al., (2008) for their D3 (our D1), but our interpretation of those structures differ.  Whereas this difference in kinematic interpretation has impact on the regional kinematics, it does not impact our proposed general model of dome development, or our interpretation of the hanging wall assemblages and the footwall-hanging wall contacts. 

## 3. 1. 2. Red River Fault

The NW-SE-striking Red River fault is traceable long along the Red River (Song Hong), and cutting Neogene conglomerate found along the river (Neogene age after Geological and Mineral Resources Map of Viet NAM 1: 200,000). The imbrication of well-rounded gravels and the intercalation of sandstone indicate these conglomerates are fluvial deposits (Fig. 6A), but this conglomerate is typical tilted at high angle (Fig. 6A). The conglomerate is cut by normal faults, but not strike-slip faults (Fig. 6B).

An excellent outcrop of conglomerate with a gouge-lined fault is at Lao Cai bridge, on the right bank of the Red River. Although the fault is a branch or splay rather than the main Red River fault, the fault is associated with a thick gouge zone of 300 m width. In outcrop, both high and low angle striations are found (Fig. 6C). In thin section, SW-down sense of shear is inferred from offsets and drag features along surfaces oblique to the gouge foliation (Fig. 6D).

Many fault outcrops along Lao Cai new road expose black fault gouge that can be easily seen from a passing car (Fig. 7A). These gouge-lined faults are not the main Red River fault, but branch faults with moderate to high angle striations within hanging wall rocks. On the margin of the gneiss dome, SW-vergent D2 folds are observed, opposite to the NE-directed D1 shear within the dome (Fig. 7B).

Based on these observations especially of the high-angle striations, Red River fault in this area appears to be a brittle (D2) normal fault bounding the SW end of the Dai Nui Con Voi dome, and is thus a D2 detachment fault (Fig. 2 bottom). Its strike-slip component may be negligible in mapped region. 

## 3. 1. 3. Song Chay Fault

The Song Chay fault is observed along the Song Chay river, especially along the Bao Yen road, and easily recognizable as a gouge-lined fault. In Bao Yen, Neogene conglomerate also crops out, and is cut by a normal fault (Fig. 8A).  The striations on gouge are high-angle (Fig. 8B), although low to moderate angle striations are also observed (Fig. 8C). Interestingly, D2 NE-vergent asymmetric folds, opposite to the SW vergence in D1 folds, are observed in gneiss and hanging wall rocks close to the Song Chay fault. Serpentinite is observed along the Song Chay fault (Fig. 8D), and the foliation strikes NW-SE and dips steeply, associated with NE-vergent minor folds. The Song Chay fault is a NW-SE-trending high-angle brittle (D2) fault. The fault is a steep normal fault down-dropped to the NE (Fig. 2 bottom). The strike-slip component is negligible. 

## 3. 2. Song Chay Dome

## 3. 2. 1. Dome

The Song Chay dome is balloon shaped, with a NE-SW axis, in contrast to the NW-SE trending Dai Nui Con Voi dome (Fig. 1). The dome straddles the Chinese border, and we have not examined the northern part of the dome.  The dome core consists of foliated granite (Fig. 9), in contrast to the gneiss of the Dai Nui Con Voi dome. These rocks are composed of biotite, quartz, and feldspar including potash feldspar (Fig. 9A, B), with some muscovite (Fig. 9C, D) and most of these minerals are metamorphic.  Therefore, the rock is gneissose granite. Large feldspars observed in outcrops are porphyroblasts (metamorphic) rather than phenocrysts (igneous) (Fig. 9E, F).

The D1 foliation is defined primarily by alignment of micas, as well as quartz subgrains, and feldspars, and the fabric does not display obvious asymmetry (Fig. 9A~D). At outcrop scale, asymmetric porphyroblasts (Fig. 9E) and asymmetric D1 folds show dome-axis-directed shear in SE limb, but deeply weathered exposures prevent an evaluation of fabric asymmetry and transport direction in the NW limb. Stretching lineations are rarely found so insufficient orientation data is available for us. 

## 3. 2. 2. Detachment Fault

The detachment fault crops out at a dam site (Fig. 10A~D). The main fault (Fig. 10C) juxtaposes granite and overlying psammitic schist (turbidite). The fault is associated with black gouge, but white gouge is observed in splay faults (Fig. 10D). Striations on the fault planes dip at high angles. The hanging wall exhibits SE and downward-vergent folds (Fig. 10B), indicating normal fault sense of shear on this major detachment fault.

The hanging wall rocks, mostly turbidites, are cut by several normal faults near to the main detachment fault (Fig. 10E). Locally observed D2 fold vergence is to the SE and bent D1 stretching lineations (Fig. 10F). Such lineations in this area display a wide range of orientations (Fig. 1) and this may reflect rotation by doming. 

## 3. 3. Bao Ha Dome

The NW-SE trending Bao Ha dome parallels the northern part of the Dai Nui Con Voi dome (Fig. 1). The dome axis is subparallel to the trend of the SW margin (Fig. 1). Although some weathered granitic rocks are present, most of the dome comprises amphibolite and siliceous schist. Notable structures are SE-vergent D1 asymmetric folds (Fig. 11A).  The NE hanging wall is shared with SW margin of the northern Dai Nui Con Voi dome (Fig. 1). The NW margin does not crop out, but hanging wall is composed of SW-dipping pelitic schist, including large calcareous schist blocks (Fig. 11B). In this area, mafic schist is closely associated with the calcareous schist, and both comprise huge exotic blocks. 

## 3. 4. Alio Shan And Phan Si Pan Domes

NE-dipping hanging wall rocks, calcareous, mafic, and psammitic schists, are present between the Alio Shan and Phan Si Pan domes.  Its lower contact with the Phan Si Pan granite is a brittle D2 fault (Fig. 12A). The Alio Shan dome in this region forms a NE-dipping homoclinal structure, rather than a dome (Figs. 1, 11B). The dome mostly consists of foliated granite, but includes gneiss (Fig. 12C, D) similar to that of the Dai Nui Con Voi dome.

D1 asymmetric pressure shadows are observed where development of the S0 foliation is relatively strong, and quartz subgrains are preferentially aligned as S1 oblique to the D0 foliation (Fig. 12C, D). The shear sense is SW-directed toward the dome axis. D2 fault gouge is observed in Loa Cai city area.

The Phan Si Pan dome includes foliated granite exposed along the Phan Si Pan mountain road. The southern half of the dome, however, consists of dacite, rhyolite, and their pyroclastic rocks. These volcanic rocks are foliated and recrystallized with growth of biotite and muscovite around relict phenocrysts of plagioclase and quartz (Fig. 12E, F).  The SW margin of the dome is a D2 brittle fault, and outcrops of fault gouge are observed along the fault-controlled valley. 

## 3. 5. Hoa Binh Dome

The northern part of this dome mainly consists of gneiss, whereas the southern part of the dome consists of granitic rocks. The northeast margin is a SW-dipping reverse fault, so this structure is not a true dome. The southwestern dome contact is not observed, but a fault is inferred from the general field relationships (Figs. 13A, B). The hanging wall rocks make up a S-plunging major anticline (Geological and Mineral Resources Map of Viet NAM 1: 200,000), but the structure is more homoclinal than domelike (Fig. 1; Figs.13C, D). 

## 3. 6. Thanh Son Dome

The Thanh Son dome is a small dome, with poor and weathered exposures but NW-SE trending dome structure can be observed (Fig. 1). The dome consists of gneiss, identical to that of the neighboring Dai Nui Con Voi dome. 

## 3. 7. Bu Khang Dome

The Bu Khang dome is southwest of the above-mentioned domes (Fig. 1). This dome has a NW-SE trend (Fig. 1), and extends across the border of Laos. The dome is a double dome, with a lower dome consisting of gneiss and amphibolite, and an upper, overlying dome consisting of calcareous schist (Fig. 1). Stretching lineations in both lithologies have a NW-SE trend (Fig. 1). 

The detachment faults juxtaposing the gneiss and calcareous schist are not observed by our observation. The upper contact of calcareous schist is marked by thick gouge fault, and observed at several places (Fig. 14A, B). The striations on the fault gouge are down-dip. Pelitic schist make up the hanging wall rocks and, near the detachment fault, these rocks are involved in D2 asymmetric folds with vergence away 
from dome axis (Fig. 14C, D). 

## 4. Hanging Wall Rocks Assemblage: Block-In-Matrix Relationships Instead Of Depositional Stratigraphy

## 4. 1. Lithological Assemblage

On the Geological and Mineral Resources Map of Viet NAM, Cambrian to Devonian strata are depicted as surrounding the metamorphic dome, which comprise mostly consist of pelitic and psamitic schists (mudstone and sandstone), with lesser amounts of calcareous and mafic schists (limestone and basalt). The ages of the hanging wall strata are based on stratigraphic (fossil) ages from a variety of lithologies, but without sufficient field context.  For example, sandstone is Devonian, limestone is Carboniferous to Permian, and thick limestone locally associated with basalt is Triassic. However, the limestone and basalt are exotic blocks (locally recognizable at map scale) in a sandy and muddy matrix.  This type of contact relationship precludes an age relationship based on conformable depositional stratigraphy, as previously interpreted.

We found several outcrops of pelagic bedded chert. The best outcrops are along the new road north of Phu Yen (Fig. 1; Fig. 15A, B), and these outcrops represent the first report of pelagic chert in Vietnam. Most of the chert is interbedded with limestone in centimeter to meter scale, but pure chert units are also observed. Under microscope, calcite crystals (micrites) are observed (Fig. 15C, D), showing that the chert was partly calcified. Planktonic thin-shelled bivalves (Koike et al., 1991; Onoue and Yoshida, 2009) and calcified radiolarians are found (Fig. 15C).  The S1 foliation is developed oblique to S0 (bedding). D1-folded umbers of 10-meter thickness is associated with these chert and limestone (Fig. 15B). Such umber deposits indicate a spreading ridge origin (Osozawa et al., 2012), consistent with the deep-ocean origin of the chert. The chert is also associated with several dolerite sills that are meters in thickness (Fig. 15A). The dolerite has well-preserved igneous texture, and contains titanaugite and augite. Secondary minerals are limited to chlorite and calcite. A gabbro dike is also found near these outcrops, and is characterized by olivine, titanaugite, and kaersutite (Fig. 15E, F). Although the contacts with the surrounding muddy and sandy matrix are not observed, these pelagic and basaltic rocks appear to be the components of exotic blocks based on map-scale contact relationships.

Exotic blocks of chert, limestone, and basalt are locally observed in several outcrops. Another characteristic lithology of this region is red, green, white, and black mudstone, locally associated with white and pale-green colored silicic tuff. These hemipelagic mudstones comprise exotic blocks. Ultramafic rocks are found along the Son Chay fault (Fig. 8D), and these are originally exotic blocks that were subsequently involved in the faulting.

We describe representative exposures of the hanging wall rocks at various localities. Southeast of the Phan Si Pan dome, trench fill turbidites comprising arkosic sandstone are exposed, and the bedding (S0) is shallower dipping than S1 (Fig. 16A). The mudstone includes limestone block (Fig. 16B). Conglomerate with rounded gravels (trench fill debris flow deposit; Fig. 16C) overlies gneissose granite, and constitutes a part of matrix. Mudstone near this conglomerate contains large exotic block of limestone (Fig. 16D).

Northeast of the Bu Khang dome, the occurrence of exotic blocks is nicely illustrated in a new road cut. Mélange matrix comprises mudstone and sandstone (Fig. 17A). Basalt shows local pillow structure (Fig. 17B; pillow lava is rarely observed in other areas), but the contact with mudstone is not observed. A typical exotic sheet-like block of limestone is observed in a turbidite matrix (Fig. 17C), and Triassic(?) thick limestone in this area comprises similar huge exotic blocks. Exotic hemipelagic mudstone also occurs as exotic blocks (Fig. 17D).

Red beds of this area are probably Cretaceous in age (Geological and Mineral Resources Map of Viet NAM), sporadically distributed across a fairly large area. Moc Chau is such an occurrence (basement of the Cretaceous in Fig. 18A), and good exposures of the Cretaceous strata are found along Song La main road (Fig. 18B). The red beds are mostly conglomeratic (Fig. 18C).  A Cretaceous unconformity is locally preserved (Fig. 18D), having escaped overprinting of Miocene deformation and metamorphism. 

## 4. 2. D1 Structure

Directly southeast of Lao Cai, between the Dai Nui Con Voi and Alio Shan domes (Fig. 1), an excellent large outcrop of hanging wall sediments with a D1 asymmetric fold is observed (Fig. 19A).  This fold is a miniature of the D1 Dai Nui Con Voi dome structure (c.f., Fig. 2), and we describe it in detail here.  The fold deforms metamorphosed turbidites represented by interbedded psammitic and pelitic schists, and defined by their folded S0. NE-vergent second-order folds are observed in the NW limb near the axial region (Fig. 19A, C). Axial plane D1 foliation (S1) is clearly defined, dipping SW at more than 60 degrees (Fig. 19B). The outcrop also displays well-developed D1 stretching lineations on the axial planes. The lineations plunge SE at about 20 degrees. Strain obtained by quartz shape fabric (Fig. 19D, E) is prolate (Fig. 3).

In XZ sections made parallel to the D1 lineations (L1) and orthogonal to the axial planar foliations (S1), dextral ductile shear is indicated by asymmetric pressure shadows around a quartz crystal (Fig. 19D).

In YZ sections (Fig. 19E), SW-dipping axial planar D1 foliations (S1) are defined by preferential alignment of biotite and muscovite (001). Fold surfaces (D0 and original bedding) are also defined by mica- rich layers, which are highly oblique to the D1 axial planar foliations (S1), in axial part of this outcrop-scale asymmetric fold (also see Fig. 19B).

Another excellent example of D1 deformation is recorded in pelagic chert, as previously noted. D1 axial planar pressure solution cleavages (S1) overlap D0 pressure solution cleavages (S0), which are parallel to original bedding planes (Fig. 15C, D). In XZ sections of this pelagic chert, asymmetric pressure shadow indicates dextral shear around a calcified radiolarian (Fig. 15C). 

## 4. 3. D2 Structure

D2 asymmetric folds that verges outward from dome axis (Fig. 2 bottom), 
opposite to the D1 fold vergence (Fig. 2 top), were shown earlier in Fig. 7B, D, Fig. 10B, F, Fig. 14D, Fig. 18A (intersection lineation).  In continuous outcrops along main road between Hoa Bihn and Mai Chau (Fig. 1), such D2 folds, that verge outward from the Hoa Bihn dome, are observed mostly in bedded calcareous schist (Fig. 20). Their NE-dipping axial planes and SW-dipping enveloping surfaces are common characteristics. Further to the southwest, around Mai Chau, the folds tend to be overturned, with NE-dipping enveloping surfaces, locally associated with NE-dipping gouge-lined faults. 

## 5. Discussion: Tectonic Model For Development Of Hanging Wall Strata And For Dome Development

For the gneissose and granitic metamorphic core complexes, protoliths are pre-Miocene granitic plutons and associated detrital rocks including Archean strata (e. g., Lan et al., 2001).  In contrast, the hanging wall rocks are not an upward-younging conformable stratigraphic sequence as interpreted on published maps.  The relationship of deep oceanic lithologies, such as alkali (seamount) basalt, umbers, pelagic chert, hemipelagic mudstone, as blocks in a matrix trench-fill turbidite indicates a typical subduction (accretionary) complex assemblage, identical to that observed in well-known orogenic belts, including those of Japan and California (e.g., Osozawa et al., 2009; Wakita and Metcalfe, 2005; Wakabayashi, 2015).

In contrast, previous studies considered basalt flood basalt and limestone platform limestone mostly of Triassic (e. g., Lepvrier et al., 2004). The block-in-matrix relationships can be observed at outcrop as well as map scale.  The fossils we found consist of Permian fusulinids (loc. shown in Fig. 1), crinoids from limestone, and planktonic shells and radiolaria from chert, but since these are all from blocks, the matrix age can only be constrained as younger.   The minimum age of the matrix and thus age of assembly of the accretionary prism is constrained only as pre Miocene, based on age of doming, and probably pre-Cretaceous based on the presence of Cretaceous red beds that overlie the basement rocks with local unconformable relationships.

Accretionary complex rocks do not have a basal depositional contact, but their base is the last position of the paleosubduction zone over which the prism accreted. Thus such rocks cannot rest unconformably upon the dome basement.   Instead the primary basal contact of such rocks must represent a collisional suture that accommodated the thrusting of accretionary complex rocks over continental basement. The basal contact of the hanging wall rocks in the domes is probably not the primary suture because it lacks large exposures of ophiolitic rocks that should typify such a suture (e.g., Moores, 1970).  It is more likely to represent a major collisional detachment fault that splayed from the main suture.

It is a possible that the collisional suture proposed above is related to the early Triassic Indosinian orogeny.  The position of the Indosinian suture has been proposed to correspond with the Song Ma fault (Lepvrier et al., 1997), based on the occurrence of ophiolites there (Hutchinson, 1975; 1989).  If accretionary complex represented by the hanging wall rocks is related to the Indosinian orogeny, then it would have been assembled prior to the metamorphism of accretionary complex and ophiolitic rocks at ca. 245 Ma (Lepvrier et al., 1997).  In this case, the underlying basement making up the domes should be the Indochina continental block (Fig. 2).

Cretaceous red beds and their basal unconformity are locally preserved.  Such rocks reflect early exhumation and subaerial exposure of the oceanic cover and the underlying continental rocks.  These exposures may represent a post-collisional basin. Such subaerial exposure of the orogenic belt apparently took place earlier to the south of the Song Ma suture, based on the Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic redbeds that unconformably overlie deformed and metamorphosed rocks in the Da Nang-Khe Sanh shear zone (Lepvrier et al., 1997).

D1 ductile deformation affected both the domes and hanging wall rocks, and metamorphism has affected most of the rocks, but particularly those in the domes. The gneiss in the domes has undergone high-grade amphibolite-granulite facies metamorphism associated with moderate geothermal gradients (e.g., Leloup et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2014).   The cause of such metamorphism remains elusive, and it is beyond the scope of this paper and our data to evaluate the origins of this metamorphism.

Lower crustal level rocks appear have suffered higher-grade metamorphism than the hanging wall rocks, and generated gneiss or gneissose granite. Higher-grade metamorphism largely destroyed or obscured the pre-D1 deformational structure, but original bedding/compositional layering (S0) is inferred from schistosity of lower-grade rocks.

Metamorphism was followed by exhumation, and the timing of the rapid cooling is constrained by 40Ar/ 39Ar and apatite fission track ages (Roger et al., 2000; Wang et al. 1998;2000; Leloup et al., 2001; Viola and Anczkiewicz, 2007; reviewed in Yeh et al., 2008). Exhumation began under dextral transpressional conditions associated with nearly upright D1 doming (Fig. 2 top). Secondary drag fold vergence or asymmetric shear sense was toward dome (anticline) axis (Fig. 2 top). Axial planar foliations common to the metamorphic core and hanging wall rocks are subvertical (Fig. 2 top). This geometry resembles that of the Kitakami granite dome in NE Japan where the secondary fold asymmetry reflects larger-scale (dome scale) flexural slip folding (Osozawa et al., 2012). The corresponding deformation in the Kitakami example is D2 (Osozawa et al., 2012), whereas this is D1 for the domes of Vietnam.

Progressive doming caused horizontal shortening and vertical extension, and the latter was associated with extrusion of the metamorphic core (Fig. 2 bottom). The upright extrusion may have been associated with D2 detachment (normal) faulting along both sides of the domes (Fig. 2 bottom). This detachment faulting was accompanied by D2 drag folding with vergence away from the dome (anticline) axis (Fig. 2 bottom). This exhumational structure may be called upright extrusional wedge, in contrast to the subhorizontal Sambagawa high-pressure extrusional wedge in SW Japan (Osozawa and Pavlis, 2007; Osozawa, 2012), although folds dominate the internal structure of the Vietnam extrusional structures, whereas Sambagawa extrusion is accommodated primarily by faults and sub-horizontal.  The D2 stage of dome deformation and exhumation resembles the upright extrusional wedge associated with late stage (Eocene) exhumation of Triassic high-pressure metamorphic rocks on Ishigaki-jima of the Ryukyu islands (Osozawa and Wakabayashi, 2012) except that the structures of the latter are much lower angle.

Similar to the structures on Ishigaki-jima, the D1 and D2 structures of the domes in Vietnam accommodate only the latest stage of exhumation, because there is a large difference in metamorphic pressure represented by the highest grade dome rocks (>1 GPa; Zhang et al., 2014) and the feebly metamorphosed rocks of the hanging wall. Such a contrast in metamorphic pressure that apparently represents >30 km of crustal thickness cannot be explained by D1 transpressional dome development or the comparatively small-scale associated detachment faulting of D2.  This suggests that larger scale extensional collapse of the hanging wall, that precedes dome development, is required to accommodate much of the exhumation of the deeper rocks (Yeh et al. 2008).

Both the Red River and Song Chay faults, the SW and NE boundary faults of the Dai Nui Con Voi dome, respectively (Fig. 1), have been considered major strike-slip faults.  The Red River fault is particularly well-known, and its dextral displacement is estimated up to 1000 km by correlation to the Chinese Ailao Shan rocks (Leloup et al., 2001). However, we did not obtain any evidence of major strike-slip components associated with these NW-SE trending faults.  Neogene tilted river gravels were deposited in the foredeep of both sides of the Dai Nui Con Voi dome, and these basins show no evidence of having originated as strike-slip basins.

The Red River fault may be a major detachment fault in this region rather than a strike-slip fault, and it extends (as a detachment fault) for a distance of over 150 km. An earlier dextral history of more broadly defined (in location) ancestral Red River and Song Chay faults may be indicated by the dextral transpressional regime of deformation associated with dome formation.

Large-scale transpressional deformation is likely to be associated with restraining bends or step-overs along major strike-slip faults (e.g., Ishigaki-jima, Osozawa and Wakabayashi, 2012) rather than characterizing an entire region that lacks through-going strike-slip faults.  The elongate nature of major domes, such as the Dai Nui Con Voi dome, may be a consequence of migration of the restraining bend(s) or step-over(s) along dextral faults (e.g., Wakabayashi et al., 2004; Wakabayashi, 2007; see application to domal uplift in Osozawa and Wakabayashi, 2012).  The reason for this is that an uplifted region formed along a static restraining step-over would be expected to have a shorter map view aspect ratio (Wakabayashi et al., 2004; Wakabayashi, 2007).  If correct, this mechanism predicts Miocene dextral strike-slip near the margins of the domes, but not necessarily directly on the dome margins (e.g., Osozawa and Wakabayashi, 2012). This mechanism predicts diachroneity of deformation along strike of major domes and it should be testable with additional field and geochronologic research.

It should be noted that this proposed mechanism for domal development and late stage exhumation of metamorphic rocks does not depend on the shear sense of the bounding strike-slip faults (ie dextral vs. sinistral).  The Indosinian suture and its splays may have provided zones of weakness exploited by Miocene strike-slip faults in addition to controlling the position of the dome detachments.

early stages of development (upper diagram) horizontal shortening associated with dextral transpression resulted in anticlinal doming and associated folding of the core and hanging wall strata of the domes.  Axial planes (S1) of folds are steeply dipping and the asymmetry of this D1 folds (F1) reflects a transport direction toward the anticlinal axes.  This is consistent with the secondary folding being associated with large-scale (dome scale) flexural slip folding, a deformational style similar to that noted for dome formation in the Kitakami region of northeastern Japan (Osozawa et al., 2012). As doming continued (lower diagram), the domes were tightened by additional shortening and steeply-dipping D2 detachment faults developed with vergence away from the anticlinal axes, associated with subvertical extrusion.  D2 asymmetric drag folds in the hanging wall strata adjacent to the detachment faults also reflect transport away from the anticlinal axes.  This geometry of deformation resembles that associated with late exhumation of high P/T metamorphic rocks on Ishigaki-jima of the Ryukyu islands (Osozawa and Wakabayashi, 2012) except that the latter structures are lower angle. The geometry is also a kind of low-angle wedge extrusion proposed by Osozawa and Pavlis (2007) for the Sambagawa high P/T metamorohic zone, although the Vietnam case has vertical geometry.

Measurements were done for deformed plagioclase porphyroblasts from gneisses (Figs. 4, 5 and another pair of thin sections), and deformed quartz grains from pelitic rocks (Fig. 19D, E). For gneisses, prolate strain is visible simply by observing XZ and YZ cut samples.

## Highlights

Elongate gneissose and granitic domes in northern Vietnam formed in a Miocene 
dextral-transpressional ductile shear regime. The hanging wall-basement interface represents part of a reactivated Indosinian collisional suture, and the hanging wall rocks comprise a subduction complex. Part of the mapped Red River fault is a detachment fault rather than a major dextral strike-slip fault.
